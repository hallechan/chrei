If you're from my high school and you're cyberstalking me, you've gone too far.
I do the same thing to my upper years, I suppose.


Otherwise, my name is Hailey and I like to design. So much so that I made it my career,
as an aspiring product (UX/UI) designer and developer.


I study at the University of Waterloo for Computer Science.
♡ specializing in Human-Computer Interaction;
♡ working towards a minor in Digital Arts Communication.


My personal website aims to showcase my work in user experience, interface, and graphic design.
I also want visitors to get an instant understanding of the person I am---visually.
I want visitors to associate me with certain colours; design styles; fonts; layouts.
That is my identity as a designer and as an artist.

I loathe LinkedIn, but I love talking to people who like to design like I do.
